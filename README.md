This open-source code is for the TYRON Network's [open-source web application](https://www.tyron.network). It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can access the [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). Edit this endpoint in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

-   [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can also check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/), which appreciates feedback and contributions!

We are deploying the web app on the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
